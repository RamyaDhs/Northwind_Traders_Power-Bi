# üìä North Wind Trades Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a detailed,Power BI dashboard built on data from **North Wind Trades**, a fictional international trading company. The primary objective of this dashboard is to visualize company-wide performance metrics, including sales distribution, employee productivity, customer demographics, and shipping efficiency. The tool enables stakeholders to quickly explore and assess critical performance indicators across multiple dimensions.

It is designed with interactivity, usability, and business decision-making in mind. Slicers and dynamic charts allow real-time filtering by year and shipping company, helping users identify patterns and trends effortlessly.

## Workflow and Methodology
**Data Inspection**
-Inspected the all tables of the dataset and identify required columns for the analysis.

-Identified the data types and issues with few columns and tables.

**Data Loading**

-Using the GET DATA tab in the Power Bi have uploaded the excel file of the Northwind Traders.

-Loaded the file to the Power Query for further Data Manipulation and Transforming.

-Removed the Columns which are not needed for the analysis, promoted the columns as headers.

-Checked for missing values, Nulls, Duplicates.

**Data Transformation**

-Transformation is needed to get a picture of what story data is trying to tell.

-Merged the Orders and Order details tables using the Order ID.

-Then Merged Orders and Product tables using the Product ID.

-Both tables got merged as Orders table only and removed the columns, duplicated which are not needed for the analysis.

**Data Modelling**

-The goal to model the tables in star schema as it provides better performance, scalability and the path is clear, simple to read for the end user.

-The Fact table is orders table and the remaining tables are Dimension Tables

-Order details table has been not loaded into the desktop as it already got merged with the orders table.

-Products table is loaded as only few required columns are merged with the orders table.
